## Course Objectives

Speech and natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence used in an increasing number of applications; yet, while some aspects are on par with human performances, others are lagging behind. This course will present the full stack of speech and language technology, from automatic speech recognition to parsing and semantic processing. The course will present, at each level, the key principles, algorithms and mathematical principles behind the state of the art, and confront them with what is know about human speech and language processing. Students will acquire detailed knowledge of the scientific issues and computational techniques in automatic speech and language processing and will have hands on experience in implementing and evaluating the important algorithms.
 
Topics:
- speech features & signal processing
- hidden markov & finite state modeling
- probabilistic parsing
- continuous embeddings
- deep learning for language-related tasks (DNNs, RNNs)
- linguistics and psycholinguistics
- comparing human and machine performance

## Prerequisites
Basic linear algebra, calculus, probability theory

## Organization

### 9 courses 
The courses take place on Monday, from 9am to 12am, remotely, between Jan 18 and March 22, 2021.

A typical course contains three parts.
- 9:00am-11:00am : watch the course content. It will be
distributed through at Youtube link a few days before (you can watch it before if you don't have a good connection).
- 11:00am- 11:30am: **on-line QUIZZ**. Attention!! you must absolutely be on-line in this time period to answer quizz questions on a google form.
- 11:30am- 12:00am: Q&A session. Live session where the answers to the QUIZZ will be revealed an questions about the course can be asked.

## oral presentation of the project

You will prepare a 10 minutes presentation and answer questions for 5 minutes.

- Thursday, 24, 2021: from 9am to 7pm:  first day of oral presentations 
- Friday, 25, 2021: from 9am to 7pm:  first day of oral presentations 

## Where:

All the courses will be delivered remotely. 

The course materials (PDFs, etc.) are listed in the subdirectories numbered #1 .. #9. 

### Validation
The validation is in two parts:

- on-line QUIZZ (40% of the total grade). This is the only part of the course where you are absolutely required to be connected on-line. You'll be given a link of a google form which will be activated exactly at 11:00am and closed down at 11:30am. Any forms submitted after the deadline will be automatically rejected, and graded as zero. The QUIZZES will contain comprehension questions and the best 5 grades out of the 6 quizzes will be used for the average. Between 11:30 and 12:00 there will be a Q&A period where you'll be able to ask questions about the course and QUIZZ using an on-line connection.

- Project. You'll be given continuous: there is no final exam, but a combination of quizzes during the lessons (20%) and two practical assignments (TDs), (40% each). ATTENTION: since there is no exam, there is no possibility of "rattrapage" (ie, of compensating a bad mark by taking another exam). So, if the overall grade obtained in this course is less than 10/20, this course will not be considered validated by the MVA Master. 

Attention, there is 


### Q&A

_What happens if i get less than 10/20 on average? Can I take another exam? _


No, there is no possibility of 'rattrapage'; any obtained grade is final.


_What happens if i cannot connect to the internet for the on-line QUIZZ on Mondays between 11:00 and 11:30?  _

This is the only part where on-line presence to the course is mandatory; only a low bandwidth connection is necessary, since it is a text-based google form. Of course, if you have a low bandwidth, it is perhaps more prudent to start watching the course before 9am on the monday of the QUIZZ, to avoid missing part of it.

Failure to submit the QUIZZ on time will result in a zero/20 for that QUIZZ, unless you can demonstrate that it was materially impossible for you to connect in that timeframe. Such documented requestes should be sent to mva.speech.language@gmail.com together with the name and date of missed QUIZZ.
